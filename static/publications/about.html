	Mote Marine Laboratory's Ocean Technology Program maintains the Southern
Operations Coastal Ocean Observing Laboratory (SO-COOL) which generates, accepts,
houses, and redistributes physical and biological data streams designed to facilitate the
study and management of our local coastal environment by researchers and agency
stewards.  Supporting partners include the State of Florida Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWC), the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System
(GCOOS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

	Much of the research efforts and resulting data are in response to Florida's
harmful algal blooms.  The Beach Conditions Reporting System (BCRS), provides the
public with twice daily assessments of beach conditions including any respiratory
irritation due to red tide.  In other work, routine cross-continental shelf transects are
flown with a robotic, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV or glider), providing near
real-time data on temperature, salinity, and other physical parameters via satellite
communications.   Mote glider assets have also been used during the response to the
Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, surveying the eastern Gulf of Mexico from SW Florida
to the Keys in concert with other gliders, to provide an integrated description of physical
conditions and to improve modeling predictions of spill trajectory and dispersal.
<p>
	Typically, the gliders carry unique instrumentation developed at Mote, the Optical
Phytoplankton Discriminator or OPD.  The OPD detects the optical signature of harmful
algal blooms of the red tide phytoplankton, Karenia brevis, as well as other
phytoplankton species, allowing advance warning of red tides originating at depth to be
provided well before satellite or ship-based observations are possible.  The OPD is the
only instrument that is presently capable of providing real time taxonomic data while
deployed robotically and autonomously and has been used by researchers both nationally
and internationally.
<p>
	Additional OPD detectors are located coastally in fixed deployments (buoys,
pilings, or docks), providing advance warning of red tides and corroborating evidence for
public reports and BCRS.  Commercial uses of OPD have included a multi-station
installation network in the vicinity of shellfishing operations.  Both mobile and fixed-
location OPD are used to respond to red tide outbreaks, to map and delineate blooms, and
provide input to agencies charged with management and public protection.
<p>
	The multiple data streams are reported centrally to the SO-COOL facility.  As a
member of the regional association of the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing
System (GCOOS), Mote also provides data for the GCOOS data portal, ultimately
participating in the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), a partnership among
federal, academic, and private parties that seek to improve responsible usage and
protection of our coastal environments through access to multiple data types.  The SO-
COOL facility also serves as joint space used for education and outreach, with the data
streams accessible for a variety of learning experiences for K-12 students and teachers.
